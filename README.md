## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned more about how to plan out a website, to use utility classes and the picture element is not well suited for custom positioning.

### Continued development

I want to learn more about how to plan out a website, especially when multiple pages need to be made. Then it will become more important to have utility classes set up. This way components can easily be reused.
